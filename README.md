## Why `torah-dl`?

Most of our generation's Torah content is locked up in websites that are not easily accessible. Sofer.Ai is building a platform to make Torah accessible to everyone, and we decided to build key parts of that platform in the open. We intend to support every website with Torah audio on our platform, and realized quickly that even finding all the sites with audio would be a full-time job. So we open-sourced `torah-dl` to make it easier for others to download Torah audio from any website, and make Torah more accessible!

## How does it work?

`torah-dl` is a library and a set of command-line tools for downloading media from Torah websites. You can use it as a command-line tool with `uv` (preferred), `pipx`, `pip`, `poetry`, `venv`, or any Python tool installer of your choice, simply by running `uv tool install "torah-dl[cli]"`, and then running `torah-dl`.

For those who want to integrate `torah-dl` into their Python application, you can simply install it via `uv add torah-dl` or `pip install torah-dl`. You can then use the library in your code as you would any other Python library:

```python
from torah_dl import extract

extraction = extract("https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/details?shiurid=1117416")

print(extraction.download_url) # https://download.yutorah.org/2024/34263/1117416/ketuvot-57a-b---preparation-for-nisuin.mp3

print(extraction.title) # Ketuvot 57a-b - Preparation for Nisuin

print(extraction.file_format) # audio/mp3

print(extraction.file_name) # ketuvot-57a-b---preparation-for-nisuin.mp3
```

## Bulk: download a whole teacher's / series' shiurim

`torah-dl` can also enumerate every shiur on a listing page and download them in one shot:

```bash
# List every shiur by a YUTorah teacher
torah-dl list-shiurim "https://www.yutorah.org/teachers/details/?teacherID=80714"

# Or just the URLs, one per line (pipe to xargs, etc.)
torah-dl list-shiurim --urls-only "https://www.yutorah.org/series/details/?seriesid=234"

# Download every shiur from a listing page into ./audio
torah-dl bulk-download "https://outorah.org/r/238" ./audio

# Cap how many to download
torah-dl bulk-download "https://allparsha.org/parsha/mishpatim" ./audio --limit 10
```

Listing extractors currently support: YUTorah teacher & series pages, OUTorah rabbi & series pages, AllDaf, AllParsha.
